    "about": "I’m a data-driven problem solver who turns information into impact. My journey began helping with my father’s business, where I learned how simple purchasing data could reveal patterns that improved decisions and sales. That spark led me to pursue analytics, blending technical precision with business insight. Now completing my Master’s in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette (graduating December 2025), I specialize in Data analytics. I’m passionate about using data to tell stories, uncover opportunities, and help organizations make smarter, faster, and more meaningful decisions."
